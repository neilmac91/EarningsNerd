## 6. EarningsNerd-Specific Content Ideas

### Series Concepts
```
1. "Earnings in 60 Seconds"
   - Weekly breakdown of major earnings
   - Use AI summary as source

2. "SEC Filing Red Flags"
   - Educational series on what to look for
   - Real examples (anonymized if needed)

3. "Finance Term of the Day"
   - Quick explainers
   - Visual demonstrations

4. "Before/After EarningsNerd"
   - Research time comparison
   - User testimonials
```

### Trend Adaptations
```
When trend emerges, ask:
1. Can this relate to investing/earnings?
2. Is the sound/format appropriate for finance?
3. Can EarningsNerd be naturally integrated?
4. Is timing still relevant?

Example adaptations:
- "POV: You finally understand earnings reports"
- "Tell me you're a retail investor without telling me"
- "Things that just make sense" [EarningsNerd demo]
```

### Compliance Guardrails
```
ALWAYS include if discussing specific stocks:
"This is educational content, not financial advice."

NEVER say:
- "You should buy/sell X"
- "This stock will go up/down"
- "Guaranteed returns"
- "Can't lose"

ALWAYS frame as:
- "Here's how to research..."
- "Investors look at..."
- "This is what [metric] means..."
```
