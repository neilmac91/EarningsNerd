"""Structural gate: GET endpoints must be read-only (WS-8 (e), security audit + follow-up).

The API authenticates with cookies as well as bearer tokens, so a GET that mutates state is a
CSRF vector (a cross-site top-level navigation carries SameSite=Lax cookies) and — unauthenticated —
a free-abuse vector (the audit's ``/trending_tickers/refresh-prices`` fanned out to a paid API on
every hit). Two AST checks over every ``@<router>.get`` handler in ``app/routers/**`` and every
``@app.get`` route in ``main.py``:

1. **Name check** — a handler must not be NAMED with a state-changing verb (``create_``,
   ``refresh_``, ``sync_`` …). Read-only verbs that merely sound active (``generate_sitemap``
   renders XML, ``export_*`` streams a download) are deliberately not in the list.
2. **Body check** — the handler body (nested defs included) must not contain a session write
   (``db.add/add_all/delete/commit/flush/merge`` on a name called ``db``/``session``), a
   ``BackgroundTasks`` parameter or ``.add_task(`` call, or ``asyncio.create_task(``. This catches
   the ``get_*``/``search_*`` handlers the name check cannot. Limitation: a write hidden behind a
   helper defined in another module is not seen — that remains a review concern.

Both allow-lists are shrink-only: a NEW hit fails with file:line and the remedy; an allow-listed
handler that no longer trips the check fails too (prune the entry — the fix is done); an entry
whose file has been deleted is tolerated so a teardown PR and this gate merge in either order.
Every entry carries its one-line justification.
