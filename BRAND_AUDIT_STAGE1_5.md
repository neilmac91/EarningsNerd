# Brand Audit - Stage 1.5

## Scope
- UI surfaces in `frontend/app/` and `frontend/components/`
- Logo usage in `frontend/public/assets/`

## Brand Pillars Reference
- Trustworthy, Accessible, Intelligent, Efficient

## Findings

### Visual Consistency
- Homepage and filing pages use premium gradients, soft shadows, and rounded containers.
- Login/register/compare/pricing use flatter styling with smaller radius and fewer accents.
- Result: brand feels uneven across journeys.

### Typography & Voice
- Marketing copy on homepage is confident and polished.
- Secondary pages use functional copy but less of the “expert friend” tone.
- Error states sometimes expose raw technical errors, which can feel less trustworthy.

### Color & UI Tokens
- Primary blues are used consistently, but some pages lean heavily on plain gray/white.
- Gradient usage is not consistent across pages.

### Logo Usage
- Logo is prominent on home, but not referenced on secondary pages.
- Suggest a lighter brand imprint (small wordmark or icon) on secondary headers for consistency.

## Recommendations
1. Align secondary pages to the brand’s premium visual style.
2. Normalize tone across errors and empty states to “expert friend”.
3. Add subtle brand cues (icon/wordmark) to secondary headers.
4. Use consistent radii, shadows, and accent gradients across pages.
